# Service Maintenance

Swiss Defibrillator offers comprehensive maintenance solutions to ensure your defibrillators operate safely and reliably.
Our Full-Service Maintenance Plan is ideal for organizations prioritizing peace of mind, with round-the-clock customer support and annual maintenance visits.

Full-Service Maintenance (Basic Plan)

1. 24/7 Support and Rapid Response
   Swiss Defibrillator provides 24/7 customer support at 079 441 24 06, ensuring immediate assistance at any time. On-site intervention is available within 48 hours of request.

2. Annual Maintenance and Inspections
   Each year, we conduct a full inspection, maintenance check, and log documentation to ensure defibrillator performance and compliance with Swissmedic guidelines. Swissmedic recommends SN EN 62353 standards for the ongoing safety and performance of electromedical devices. This Swiss standard mandates visual inspections, functional checks, and specific tests on equipment like defibrillators, ensuring they meet safety requirements throughout their lifespan. We also provide optional services, such as:
   - Replacement of adult electrodes every 24 months.
   - Battery replacement every 48 months, including installation.
   - Data transfer of the electrocardiogram to a specified hospital or physician if compatible with the device model.
   - Emergency delivery of a loaned defibrillator if your device needs repair (up to one month).

3. Convenient Rates and Payment Plans
   Our Full-Service Maintenance Plan is CHF 275 per year (CHF 310 with AIVIA100 Wallmount) plus VAT, with a first-year discount and additional reductions for clients with multiple defibrillators.

For clients interested in essential coverage, our Basic Maintenance Plan offers flexible maintenance services, including proactive notifications two weeks before pads or batteries expire and replacements managed as needed. This plan charges only for replacement items and any service interventions, ensuring budget-friendly maintenance.

Swiss Defibrillator is committed to Swissmedic standards and regulatory compliance, providing dependable maintenance that meets rigorous quality and safety standards for electromedical equipment in Switzerland.
