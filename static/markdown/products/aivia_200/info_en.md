# AIVIA 200

**Wall Cabinet for AED External Automated Defibrillator AIVIA 200**

- The AIVIA 200 can be installed indoors or outdoors.
- It combines robustness and lightness, comprising two distinct parts:
  - The polycarbonate cover
  - The ABS support
- These materials, widely used in the automotive industry, offer remarkable shock resistance characteristics. For instance, polycarbonate is commonly used for vehicle headlights, while ABS is utilized for bumpers.

## **Signage**

- On the front, you'll find a survival chain and three explicit pictograms illustrating how to proceed in case of use.
- The AED (Anglo-Saxon) and DAE (Latin) labels are placed on the sides, separate from the specific defibrillator logo (a heart broken by an electric arc).
- RAL6024, Traffic Green, is the official color used for the AIVIA wall mount for defibrillators. This vibrant green ensures high visibility in emergencies and is applied not only to the wall support but also to the sticker, AED sign, and fast response kit from the brand "WAP," making it easily recognizable and accessible in critical moments.

## **Features**

- Day/night lighting of the AED compartment by LEDs with automatic brightness detection.
- Access to the AED is safeguarded by plastic seals.
- Opening the cover automatically triggers a visual alarm with flashing red LEDs.
- An optional audible alarm activates upon opening the cover.
- The optional heating is linked with a temperature sensor, activating once the minimum threshold is reached.
- Anomalies, such as temperatures out of range, are signaled by a visual alarm through red LEDs.

## **Positioning**

- The mains power supply (24 volts DC) allows for installing the heating option, enabling outdoor positioning, for example, on public roads.
- Ventilation reduces excessive temperatures in the AED compartment without acting as an air conditioner. It's crucial to place the AIVIA in the shade to avoid the greenhouse effect from sunlight radiation.
