# Article 36 of the The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)

**KAI! Hier muss der PDF angehängt als download stehen – beide Versionen auf der EN Webseite, dann die FR Version auf die FR und die DE auf die DE Webseite, der ist leider nur auf Deutsch und Französich…**The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in Switzerland recommends the following guidelines for first aid provision in companies, as outlined in Article 36.

- Necessary means for First Aid must always be available, considering the hazards, size, and location of the establishment. Equipment should be easily accessible and placed according to working conditions:

- Adequately located medical rooms and trained personnel should be available if needed, easily accessible with stretchers, and clearly marked.

- The first aid concept must align with the establishment's characteristics, specifying training, number of First Aiders, and resources required. It should ensure accessibility to emergency services at all times, even outside regular working hours.

- First Aid equipment should match the establishment's hazards and undergo regular quality checks. Special provisions are needed for individuals working alone or in non-fixed workplaces to ensure prompt assistance in emergencies.

- Trained personnel should be proficient in recognizing and addressing emergencies, including CPR and AED usage. Refresher courses should be attended regularly.

- Overall, the establishment must ensure effective First Aid provision, considering operational conditions and hazards, with clear marking of first aid facilities and equipment.

- Recommended First Aid courses certified by IVR/IAS (www.ivr-ias.ch) or First Aid courses with comparable learning and performance objectives.
