# Philips HS-1 Plexiglas Overview

## About

- The Philips HS-1 Plexiglas Wall Mount is a simple, elegant solution for storing the Philips HeartStart HS-1 Defibrillator, ensuring it is visible and accessible in case of an emergency.
- The AED can be attached to the wall mount with an easily breakable string, allowing for quick access when needed. However, this setup is more suitable for indoor office environments or non-public areas, as it does not provide secure storage against potential theft in public spaces.

## Features

- Its clear design not only protects the AED from dust and damage but also allows for its status indicator to be seen at a glance.
