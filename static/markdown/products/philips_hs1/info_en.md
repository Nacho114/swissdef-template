# HS-1 HeartStart OnSite Philips Defibrillator: Everyone Can Save Lives

Having the right equipment and support can mean the difference between life and death. The Philips HeartStart HS1 Defibrillator with Life Guidance provides clear step-by-step instructions, ensuring anyone can confidently take action to save a life. Intuitive guidance and intelligent technologies guarantee accuracy, empowering individuals to act decisively in a cardiac emergency.

## **Ready to Act. Ready to Help.**

The HS1 Defibrillator is designed for everyone to save lives. Always ready for use, it enables swift and effective treatment of sudden cardiac arrest, the leading cause of heart failure, through rapid defibrillation.

## **Guided Application**

Activating the HeartStart HS1 is as simple as pulling the green handle. Life Guidance voice instructions calmly lead you through the entire process, from pad placement to CPR and shock delivery. Feedback is provided on compression rate, depth, and ventilation.

## **Ready for Immediate Use**

Your HeartStart HS1 comes fully equipped and ready to use. For personal use, you can start immediately, while commercial use requires setup by authorized personnel on-site.

## **Clear and Concise Voice Instructions**

Even inexperienced rescuers are guided step by step through CPR and defibrillation, ensuring accurate delivery of life-saving measures.

## **Benefits of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED)**

In Switzerland, over 8,000 people die from sudden cardiac arrest annually. Time is critical, and early intervention with CPR and AED use can increase survival rates by up to 75%.

## **Save Time. Save Lives.**

In a sudden cardiac arrest scenario, quick and deliberate action is essential. Equipped with SMART Pads, the HeartStart HS1 ensures that instructions are tailored to the situation, allowing you to stay calm and focused.

## **Fast and Reliable Shock Delivery**

Studies show that delivering a shock promptly after CPR increases survival chances. The Quick Shock feature of the HS1 significantly reduces the time between CPR and shock delivery, typically within 8 seconds.

## **Efficient Therapy and Optimized Care**

The HS1 is suitable for all patients and adjusts therapy accordingly. It delivers a shock only when a defibrillable rhythm is detected, preventing unnecessary shocks.

## **Ease of Use**

Designed for individuals without prior experience, the HS1 provides clear instructions and is the most reliable defibrillator on the market, backed by several published studies.
