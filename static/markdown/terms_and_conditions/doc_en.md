# Terms and Conditions

This document outlines the terms and conditions governing the relationship between Swiss Defibrillator Sàrl and its customers. These terms cover product warranty, maintenance, training, invoicing, and payment procedures, ensuring clarity and mutual understanding.

## 1. Product Warranty and Maintenance

### a) Warranty

The defibrillator is covered by an 8-year manufacturer's warranty from Philips Health Care, with a delivery time of 1 to 2 weeks. This includes one-time setup offered by Swiss Defibrillator, with the customer responsible for installation. Installation typically involves mounting the AIVIA100 wall mount using four screws on the wall. While installation is usually the responsibility of the client, in cases where the client is unable to perform the installation, Swiss Defibrillator Sàrl can undertake the task. However, in such instances, the client must sign an agreement acknowledging that Swiss Defibrillator cannot be held liable for any damages to their wall. It's important to note that certain walls may contain cables or other elements that could potentially cause damage, and while Swiss Defibrillator will exercise caution, they cannot assume responsibility for such occurrences. Swiss Defibrillator Sàrl, in collaboration with ProCardio BV, serves as the official representative of Philips for the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the UK, guaranteeing quality and reliability.

### b) Maintenance

Regular maintenance is essential, with electrodes replaced every 2 years and batteries every 4 years. Swiss Defibrillator Sàrl proactively inquires before the expiration dates of pads and batteries to ensure timely replacements. Customers receive proactive notifications before expiration by opting the light Service Maintenance.
