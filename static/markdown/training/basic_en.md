# Basic Training

## BLS-AED-SRC Complet (Generic Provider)

### Objectives

Participants apply basic resuscitation (BLS: Basic Life Support) measures in various situations, including automated external defibrillation (AED), for both children and adults, while ensuring their own safety. They:

- Promptly raise the alarm.
- Consider their own safety while providing assistance.
- Apply basic resuscitation techniques on adult and child training models, including high-performance CPR, ventilation, and defibrillation using an AED.
- Recognize typical characteristics of cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and stroke, explaining prevention possibilities.
- Perform correct recovery position in case of unconsciousness.
- Explain measures to take in case of airway obstruction by a foreign body.
- Apply BLS measures in concrete scenarios, focusing on target groups.
- Reflect on their own motivation to provide assistance.
- Describe how to manage adverse factors during first aid.
- Are informed about possible integration into the first responder system.

### Training Content

The comprehensive BLS-AED-SRC (Basic Life Support – Automated External Defibrillator – Swiss Resuscitation Council) course aims to deepen and optimally apply basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BLS-AED) techniques during cardiac arrest in adults and children in various contexts. It targets healthcare professionals, first responders (firefighters, police officers, workplace first aiders, lifeguards, on-duty Samaritans, etc.), and anyone wishing to maintain their skills in cases of cardiac emergency, myocardial infarction, hypoxic emergency, or stroke (e.g., caregivers of cardiac patients, etc.).

The course imparts "BLS-AED principles of the SRC" with the goal of deepening knowledge and applying basic resuscitation measures in specific situations.

The course content includes:

- Assisting while ensuring personal protection.
- Identifying and assessing emergency situations.
- Transmitting national emergency numbers (and if necessary, local emergency numbers as well).
- Situation awareness and problem-solving in various emergency situations, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
- Explanation and discussion of the chain of survival.
- Recovery position in case of unconsciousness.
- Measures for airway obstruction by a foreign body.
- Actions according to the BLS-AED-SRC algorithm.
- Basic skills training for adults and children: initial assessment, CPR, ventilation, AED defibrillation.
- Collaboration with non-professional rescuers and professional lifeguards.
- Teamwork and communication.
- Handling at least 2 scenarios with different complexities (including at least one scenario with a shockable rhythm and one with a non-shockable rhythm).
- Motivations for first aid, including favorable and unfavorable influences.
- Fundamental ethical principles.
- Legal aspects: liability in case of non-assistance.
- Mention of participation in the First Responder systems.
- Open discussion of questions.
