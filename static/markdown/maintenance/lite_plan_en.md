# Basic Service Maintenance

Introducing Swiss Defibrillator's Hassle-Free Maintenance Plan:

- Before the expiration dates of pads and batteries, we kindly inquire if our clients wish to proceed with replacements, allowing us to ship them in advance.

- Operating on a pay-as-you-go basis, our clients are billed solely for the services or products they utilize.

- Opting for our basic service entrusts us with the management of pad and battery expiration dates, eliminating any worries.

- Swiss Defibrillator ensures proactive notifications two weeks before pad and battery expiration, ensuring timely replacements.

- Batteries are priced at CHF 229, while pads (HS-1 and FRx) are CHF 97 each.

- Clients receive an invoice covering the full price of the battery and/or pads, along with standard Swiss Post shipping costs.

- Additionally, clients can request an AED report for CHF 30. All prices are subject to 8.1% VAT.

- Importantly, our basic service maintenance incurs no annual costs, with fees only applicable upon pad and/or battery replacements.

- If the client opts for Swiss Defibrillator to deliver the service, rest assured, it's entirely feasible. Our service intervention fee stands at CHF 90 plus VAT, encompassing all facets of the service, including the technician's travel costs and service time. It's important to note that this fee excludes the cost of pads and/or batteries, which are charged separately.

- This approach guarantees cost-effectiveness and peace of mind for our esteemed clients.
