# Remote Service Maintenance

Swiss Defibrillator now offers a Remote Maintenance Plan tailored for organizations that prefer flexible, remote support while ensuring their defibrillators operate safely and reliably. Our Remote Maintenance Plan combines the convenience of video-assisted guidance and fast delivery of replacement components, ensuring your equipment remains compliant with Swiss standards.

#### 24/7 Remote Support and Rapid Assistance
Swiss Defibrillator provides 24/7 customer support at 079 441 24 06. Immediate assistance is available through phone or video calls, ensuring that any issues are addressed promptly and effectively. In case of urgent needs, a replacement defibrillator will be shipped within 48 hours.

#### Annual Maintenance and Inspections – Done Remotely
Each year, we guide you through a comprehensive remote inspection and maintenance check via video call, following Swissmedic guidelines and SN EN 62353 standards. Our experts will visually assess your defibrillator, instruct you on performing functional checks, and conduct specific tests to ensure the safety and performance of the device.

**What’s Included:**

- **Remote Guidance for Replacement of Adult Electrodes**: Every 24 months, new electrodes will be shipped to your location, and our experts will assist you via video call to guide the replacement process.
- **Battery Replacement Every 48 Months**: Batteries are shipped to you, and remote assistance is provided for proper installation and testing.
- **Data Transfer Assistance**: If your defibrillator model supports data transfer, our specialists will guide you through the process of transferring the electrocardiogram data to the specified hospital or physician during the video session.
- **Loaned Defibrillator Delivery**: In case your device needs repair, we will ship a loaned defibrillator to you (up to one month) while your equipment is serviced.

#### Annual Remote AED Report
After each remote maintenance session, you will receive a detailed AED report via email, which includes:
- The service date
- Expiration dates of the battery and pads
- The next scheduled service date

This report provides all the necessary information to keep your defibrillator compliant and ready for use, all from the convenience of your location.

### Exclusions
Please note that incidents unrelated to regular maintenance, such as fire, earthquake, theft, or other extraordinary events, are not covered by this plan.

### Affordable Rates and Flexible Payment Options
Our Remote Maintenance Plan is CHF 225 per year (CHF 260 with AIVIA100 Wallmount) plus VAT. The fee includes one battery replacement every 4 years and one set of pads every 2 years, ensuring cost-effective, worry-free maintenance. A first-year discount is available, along with additional reductions for clients with multiple defibrillators.

For clients needing essential coverage, our **Basic Remote Maintenance Plan** offers flexible services, including proactive notifications two weeks before pads or batteries expire and shipping replacements as needed.
